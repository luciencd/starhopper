The original main feature of this project, to generate star-hopping paths to follow using binoculars that would be listed off by an amazon alexa app is impossible to implement, even under perfect conditions with human intelligence.

Pivot: This alexa skill will be an astronomer's personal assistant, listing off the position of any object in the night sky in any coordinate system, to avoid having to look at a screen and ruining night vision.

The additional cool feature will be to let a user know when a star and a deep sky object have identical altitude or azimuth, so that they only have to pivot the telescope along one axis, reducing the 2d search problem to a 1d search problem.

Additional features based off the one above would just act as wrappers, giving out random star-DSO pairs based on a number of filters.
